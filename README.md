# tuberculosis-resistance-classification
 Python based pipeline for classifying Mycobacterium Tuberculosis first-line drugs resistance from DNA genome sequence powered by ML model

# Tools
Tools/library used in the pipeline :
- Tabula : Extracting DST data from pdf files into csv
- enaWebTools (FTP) : https://github.com/enasequence/enaBrowserTools
- ARIBA : https://github.com/sanger-pathogens/ariba <br>
- scikit-learn : https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn
- TensorFlow : https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow

From scratch RF and DT code : https://github.com/zhaoxingfeng/RandomForest

# Current Progress 
Goals need to be achieved :
- Learn about Paralel and Information Gain (Unweight, Joint, Maximum)
- Modify RF and DT classifier into MLRF and Reinforced RF.
- Download all the dataset
- Create model metric (AUC etc)
